            <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
                Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
                Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
                And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
                But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
                Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
                When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
                So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
                 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br> 
                Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br>   
                The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br> 
                Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br> 
                Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br> 
                The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br>    
                The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br> 
                The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>    
                Are full of passionate intensity.<br>
